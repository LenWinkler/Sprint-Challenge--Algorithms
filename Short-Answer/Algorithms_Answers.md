## Exercise I

a) O(n). It scales linearly with input size. The code runs n times.


b) I want to say O(log(n)) here because the number of operations seems to scale slower than the input. I also 
"ran" the code with pen and paper a few times and plugged the number of loops into a log2 calculator and the 
result was ~n. 


c)

## Exercise II
